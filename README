TCP/IP protocols applications

A series of university assigned projects:

- Router: implementation of a router that uses the IP, ICMP and ARP protocols

- TCP/UDP client server application: an app that allows TCP clients to connect
to a server and subscribe to various topics, and recieve messages related to
those topics when sent by the UDP clients via the server. The application
implement both TCP and UDP protocols

- HTTP client book store: a client that connects to a REST API that serves and
processes books in JSON format. The client can perform a series of HTTP
requests to the server, GET, POST and DELETE, as well as authenticate and keep
track of cookies and tokens. The application implements the HTTP protocol
(making HTTP requests)

- Client Server Sharepoint simulation: a client-server app that simulates a
sharepoint, a file drive to which more people have access. The app uses the TCP
protocol to simulate an HTTP client and server. The app handles both HTTP
requests and HTTP handling
